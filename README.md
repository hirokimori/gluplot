# gluplot

Log file viewer of Abbott's Freestyle Libre.

## Motivation
The web site (libre view) and the smartphone app provided by Abbott was not satisfactory for me in terms of the resolution of the glucose plot and the display of the annotated text (memo) because I wanted to know what activity affects my glucose level by how soon, how much and how long.
